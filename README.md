- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Malder44.
- I'm a student at Alura, a brazilian platform of technology courses.
- Currently, I'm learning and focusing on Front-End Developing, working with basics of HTML5, CSS3 and JS, for now. My next steps is to go deeper inside this branch and explore 
more of this vast world of front-end.
- At the moment, I'm recreating some projects made in Alura classes, creating similar projects and making a few real projects.
- Feel free to contact me in any moment!
